# CAR SEAT

_Library and service/s that aim to save lives by sending emergency notifications to parents and/or authorities if a child is left in a car seat._

## Description

There are way too many incidents (especially in the Phoenix, AZ area) where a parent forgets that their child is in the car seat.  Even worse, there are occassions when the 
parent does it intentionally.

The project aims to provide tools, libraries, SDKs, and services that would assist developers to create life saving software.

## Goals

1. Central service that clients (mobile apps, car seat device, etc. communicate with).
2. Notifications to parents (via SMS, Email, Emergency alert, etc.)
3. Escalated notifications to local authorities.
